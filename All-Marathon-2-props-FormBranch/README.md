# FormWithCrud
This is the simple form that can use for the validation of the form and that can store data into the localStorage of the webBrowser.


# Question 
Creating a form with validation and performing CRUD operations on local storage involves designing a web form that allows users to enter data, and then storing that data in the browser's local storage. .saved record should be saved in table and from there user should be able to edit and delete recrods Here are the steps involved in creating such a form:

## Rules 

Design the form: Choose the fields that you want to include in the form. Here are ten different input types 
that you might consider using:

Text input: Allows users to enter free-form text.

Email input: Requires users to enter a valid email address.

Phone number input: Restricts input to numbers and special characters typically used in phone numbers.

Date input: Allows users to select a date from a calendar.

Time input: Allows users to select a time from a dropdown.

Checkbox input: Allows users to select one or more options from a list of choices.

Radio button input: Allows users to select one option from a list of choices.

Range input: Allows users to select a value within a range by dragging a slider.

Dropdown input: Allows users to select one option from a dropdown list.

File input: Allows users to upload a file.

Add validation: 
    Write JavaScript code to validate the form inputs. For example, you might ensure that required fields are filled in, validate email addresses, or ensure that numbers fall within a certain range.

Implement CRUD operations: Write JavaScript code to perform CRUD operations on the data entered into the form. This might involve storing the data in local storage, retrieving it, updating it, and deleting it.

Test the form: Test the form to ensure that it works as expected. Try entering invalid data to ensure that the validation logic works correctly. Verify that the data is stored correctly in local storage and can be retrieved, updated, and deleted as needed.

Name (text input)
Email (email input)
Phone number (phone number input)
